# DWP Frontend toolkit

![POSTER FOR TOOLKIT](https://github.com/paulmsmith/fe-toolkit/blob/master/public/images/docs/dwp_fe_poster.jpg?raw=true)

To form part of the DWP Design System. A trial for the DWP Frontend Toolkit using [Fractal](http://fractal.build). I'm getting this to a place where people can contribute, push back, improve.

## To do:

- [X] Scaffold app structure
- [X] Update fractal configuration + theme
- [ ] Write documentation (Introduction/Overview, how-to, principles, code standards..) **[Started this]**
- [ ] Integrate existing gov.uk frontend resources
- [ ] Write gulp tasks (Fractal CLI, linting, building, compressing assets, ..etc)

[See more in the project 'build'](https://github.com/paulmsmith/fe-toolkit/projects/2)

## Questions / Feedback

Any questions or feedback, please raise an issue within this repository. When it's ready it will be moved to the organisation respository for wider contribution. I'm merely getting this up and running in my spare time because I believe it's important. I will 'show the thing' at a future UX or Frontend meeting.
