# DWP Frontend toolkit

![POSTER FOR TOOLKIT](https://github.com/paulmsmith/fe-toolkit/blob/master/public/images/docs/dwp_fe_poster.jpg?raw=true)

To form part of the DWP Design System. A trial for the DWP Frontend Toolkit using [Fractal](http://fractal.build). I'm getting this to a place where people can contribute, push back, improve.

## To do:

- [X] Scaffold app structure
- [X] Update fractal configuration + theme
- [ ] Write documentation (Introduction/Overview, how-to, principles, code standards..) **[Started this]**
- [ ] Integrate existing gov.uk frontend resources
- [ ] Write gulp tasks (Fractal CLI, linting, building, compressing assets, ..etc)

[See more in the project 'build'](https://github.com/paulmsmith/fe-toolkit/projects/2)

## Process

Service hypothesises solution to problem -> develops -> tests -> refines -> proves -> publishes.
Solution is used and is identified or proposed as a ‘Pattern’. 

Pattern is reviewed, tested and built in the best way possible:

1. Accessible
2. Performant
3. Maintainable.
4. Reusable.

## Purpose of the DWP Front-end Toolkit:

* Single place for DWP Teams to find ‘Production Ready’ HTML + CSS + Javascript for Citizen facing and internal services. **Stop teams using bootstrap!**

* Documentation for how teams should write, test and maintain HTML + CSS + Javascript for the DWP. Get teams doing things consistently to a high standard.

* A way for teams and developers to write their own patterns and code which can be shared back with the department (and wider gov). **Avoid teams solving the same problems.**

## Our users:

- Developers (internal and external):
- Front-end developers
- 'Full stack developers' & Backend developers
- Designers (internal & external):
- Interaction Designers

## What we’re not doing:

- Building components or code not identified in services as genuine UI or interaction patterns. 
- Creating something that competes with or counter acts [gov.uk frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_alpha) we want to work alongside and contribute to the efforts of The Government Digital Service.

## Questions / Feedback

Any questions or feedback, please raise an issue within this repository. When it's ready it will be moved to the organisation respository for wider contribution. I'm merely getting this up and running in my spare time because I believe it's important. I will 'show the thing' at a future UX or Frontend meeting.
