<h2 id="inset-text">Inset text</h2>

<div class="demo">

</div>

<p>Bordered text is used to draw attention to important content on the page. This can appear within the flow of body content. This element is detailed in the <a href="http://govuk-elements.herokuapp.com/typography#typography-inset-text">Government Service Design Manual</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="alert-message">Alert message</h2>

<p>Alert messages usually appear at the top of the page, underneath the main heading. They span the width of a text column. In full-width layout keep the maximum number of characters per line to about 75 (⅔ the width of the page at desktop size).</p>

<h3 id="alert-message-default">Default alert message</h3>

<p>Use this when:</p>

<ul>
	<li>a section of text is the most important feature of the page</li>
	<li>when text needs to be highlighted and inset text hasn't worked</li>
	<li>the user must take a significant action apart from the service, eg make a phone call</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="alert-message-warning">Warning alert message</h3>

<p>Use this when:</p>

<ul>
	<li>there’s an issue that a user should know about, but they didn’t cause.</li>
</ul>

<div class="demo">

</div>

<h3 id="alert-message-positive">Positive alert message</h3>

<p>Use this when:</p>

<ul>
	<li>there's been a discrete action during a transaction, but the user hasn’t completed their full journey, eg they've sent something or saved something.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="legal-text">Legal text</h2>

<p>You must call out anything that may affect the user personally or financially. This element is detailed in the Government Service Design Manual.</p>

<p>A border is not required around and it can be included anywhere within the main content of a page. Almost all transactional services will have this on a declaration page, warning of consequences of fraud.</p>

<div class="demo">
	<img src="/images/content/patterns/alerts/legal-text.png" alt="">
</div>

<p>Use a vertically centred icon when messages are short and up to around 75 characters (1 line at wide browser viewports)</p>

<div class="demo">
	<img src="/images/content/patterns/alerts/legal-text-multiline.png" alt="">
</div>

<p>Use a top-aligned icon when messages are longer than 75 characters (2 lines or more at wide browser viewports)</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="error-message">Error message</h2>

<p>This element is detailed in the <a href="http://govuk-elements.herokuapp.com/errors/">Government Service Design Manual</a> and normally appears above the main heading of a page.</p>

<p>Use this when:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the user has done something that's caused an error</li>
	<li>there’s a problem that the user needs to do something about</li>
</ul>

<div class="demo">

<ul>
	<li>a user has completed an action successfully</li>
	<li>a user has finished a transaction</li>
</ul>

<div class="demo">
	<img src="/images/content/patterns/alerts/confirmation.png" alt="">
