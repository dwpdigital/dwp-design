<h2 id="about">About patterns</h2>

These patterns for DWP services are based on the research and experience of the DWP design community. You should use them to build on the GOV.UK design patterns.

These are the recommended standards for DWP service design. You should use them even when live services (like Carer’s Allowance) don’t yet follow them.
