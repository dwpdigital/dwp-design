</div>

<p>Bordered text is used to draw attention to important content on the page. This can appear within the flow of body content. This element is detailed in the <a href="http://govuk-elements.herokuapp.com/typography#typography-inset-text">Government Service Design Manual</a>.</p>

<h2 id="alert-message">Alert message</h2>

<p>Alert messages usually appear at the top of the page, underneath the main heading. They span the width of a text column. In full-width layout keep the maximum number of characters per line to about 75 (â…” the width of the page at desktop size).</p>

<h3 id="alert-messahe-default">Default alert message</h3>

<p>Use this when:</p>

<ul>
	<li>a section of text is the most important feature of the page</li>
	<li>when text needs to be highlighted and inset text hasn't worked</li>
	<li>the user must take a significant action apart from the service, eg make a phone call</li>
</ul>
