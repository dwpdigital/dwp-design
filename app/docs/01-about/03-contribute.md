---

<p>There are multiple ways to contribute, such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Use the existing patterns documented here and share your research about 
		how well (or not) they worked within your service for your users.
	</li>
	<li>
		You could have patterns of your own that you believe will benefit other 
		services within DWP. If so, you can submit a pattern or research for 
		consideration.
	</li>
</ul>

	software application called 'Fractal'. To be able to contribute a pattern or 
	component directly to this library, first you will will need to install the
